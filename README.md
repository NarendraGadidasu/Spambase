2.Open the folder 'spambase'  
3.If 'output' folder does not exit, create it.  
4.Run the file 'parse data.py'  
5.RUn all the remaining .py files  
6.Running the file 'ANN_coarsened_grid.py' will overwrite the results of 'ANN.py' and viceversa. Use coarsened grid to check the effect of iterations etc.. only.  
7.Running the file 'SVM_coerce_iterations.py' will overwrite the results of 'SVM.py' and viceversa. Use coerce_iterations to check the effect of iterations only.  
8.After running all the files, open 'output' folder and run all the .py files in it.
